# Payroll and Health Provider financial data comparison application


## About

This is a full-stack application built on Flask and React that enables KaiMing company to upload their raw financial data reports and extract key insights to accelerate their workflow and eliminate human error. It works like this: Upload the raw payroll data for the month as well as the Health Provider's data and feed it to the application. Then, select the YEAR and MONTH you'd like to compare the data with. Finally, press the "compare" button and you will be able to generate a table that shows you any mismatches between what deductions each employee receives and what the Health provider has reported back. This allows users to quickly see who's data needs to updated, by how much, and for which provider and pay period. By doing this, you save several hours of manual searching and reporting, as well as eliminate human error from calculating the differences.
